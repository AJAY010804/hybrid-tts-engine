# hybrid-tts-engine
A hybrid Python Text-to-Speech engine that works both online and offline. It uses Microsoft Edge neural voices when the internet is available, and automatically switches to offline mode using pyttsx3 when it's not. The engine includes polite fallback messages and audio playback powered by pygame.
